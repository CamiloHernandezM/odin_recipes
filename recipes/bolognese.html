    <h3>Description</h3>
    <div id="description">
        <p>Bolognese sauce, known in Italian as ragù alla bolognese or ragù bolognese (called ragù in the city of Bologna, ragó in Bolognese dialect), is a meat-based sauce in Italian cuisine, typical of the city of Bologna. It is customarily used to dress tagliatelle al ragù and to prepare lasagne alla bolognese.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Outside Italy, the phrase "Bolognese sauce" is often used to refer to a tomato-based sauce to which minced meat has been added; such sauces typically bear little resemblance to Italian ragù alla bolognese, being more similar in fact to ragù alla napoletana from the tomato-rich south of the country. Although in Italy ragù alla bolognese is not used with spaghetti (but rather with flat pasta, such as tagliatelle),[2][3][4] "spaghetti bolognese" has become a popular dish in many other parts of the world.[where?]</p>
